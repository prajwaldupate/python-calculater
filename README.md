Project Name: Python Calculator
Project Description:
Python Calculator is a command-line application that performs basic mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is developed using Python programming language.
The calculator can perform the following operations:
1.	Addition
2.	Subtraction
3.	Multiplication
4.	Division
Users can choose any operation they want to perform and input the numbers they want to calculate. The calculator then displays the result of the calculation.
This project is developed using object-oriented programming concepts and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to make the code more maintainable and readable.
Features:
•	Basic mathematical operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
•	Error handling for invalid input.
•	Object-oriented programming approach.
•	Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.
•	Code follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
Installation:
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.	Install Python 3.7 or higher.
3.	Run the 'calculator.py' file in the command-line interface.
Usage:
1.	Run the 'calculator.py' file in the command-line interface.
2.	Choose the operation you want to perform.
3.	Input the numbers you want to calculate.
4.	The calculator will display the result of the calculation.
